"Figure 9b plots the number of excess jobs against the number of missing jobs, both normalized by pretreatment employment, for our 16 treated industry-by-region groups. The 45-degree line marks the points where excess jobs exactly equal missing jobs, i.e., where there is no effect on employment."

[""This is the first assessment of restaurant employment and earnings over the entire period of New York City’s historic minimum wage increases. Contrary to fears of massive job losses, $20 Big Macs, and shuttered restaurants, we found a thriving industry.""](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/a6170fa466dd7c8eed0aab6be/files/b2f3acd5-3884-42a7-a0bf-fa410b2b6544/Final_CNYCA_NELP_NYC_Min_Wage_Restaurants.pdf) 

[""On April 1, 1992 New Jersey's minimum wage increased from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour. To evaluate the impact of the law we surveyed 410 fast food restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania before and after the rise in the minimum. Comparisons of the changes in wages, employment, and prices at stores in New Jersey relative to stores in Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage remained fixed at $4.25 per hour) yield simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage. Our empirical findings challenge the prediction that a rise in the minimum reduces employment. Relative to stores in Pennsylvania, fast food restaurants in New Jersey increased employment by 13 percent. We also compare employment growth at storesin New Jersey that were initially paying high wages (and were unaffected by the new law) to employment changes at lower-wage stores. Stores that were unaffected by the minimum wage had the same employment growth as stores in Pennsylvania, while stores that had to increase their wages increased their employment.](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w4509/w4509.pdf)
