https://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Black-Lives-Matter.pdf**Extensive document on racial biases** in our criminal justice system.Studies seem to indicate **about 61-80% of black overrepresentation in prisons** can be explained by **higher black crime rates**, with the unexplained portion largely attributable to **racial bias**.Remember - the factors which lead to **disproportionate criminality** amongst black Americans are also in large part a **product of racial bias**. Underfunded public programs, redlining, generational poverty, bad schooling, and myriad other factors which **influence criminality** can also be traced to **racial bias.**
[**Investigation of the Ferguson Police Department**](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf)Between 2012 and 2014, **black people in Ferguson** accounted for **85 percent of vehicle stops, 90 percent of citations and 93 percent of arrests**, despite comprising **67 percent of the population.****Blacks were more than twice as likely** as whites to be searched after traffic stops even after controlling for related variables, though **they proved to be 26 percent less likely** to be in possession of **illegal drugs or weapons.**Between 2011 and 2013, **blacks also received 95 percent of jaywalking tickets and 94 percent of tickets for “failure to comply.”** The Justice Department also found that the **racial discrepancy for speeding tickets increased dramatically** when researchers looked at tickets based on only an officer’s word vs. tickets **based on objective evidence**, such as a radar.Black people facing **similar low-level charges as white people** were **68 percent less likely to see those charges dismissed in court. More than 90 percent** of the arrest warrants stemming from failure to pay/failure to appear **were issued for black people.**

[**The Concentrated Racial Impact of Drug Imprisonment and the Characteristics of Punitive Counties**](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/vortex.pdf)While White & Black Americans **admit to using and selling illicit drugs at similar rates**, Black Americans are **VASTLY more likely to go to prison** for a drug offense.In 2002, **Black Americans were incarcerated for drug offenses at TEN TIMES** the rate of White Americans.Today, **Blacks are 3.7x as likely to be arrested for a marijuana offense** as Whites, **despite similar usage**.**97% of “large-population counties”** have **racial biases** in their drug offense incarceration.
[**Militarization fails to enhance police safety or reduce crime but may harm police reputation**](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/37/9181)**Police militarization does not lead to a decrease** in crimes committed or officer injuries, **may actually increase both**.Police militarization (including the adoption of SWAT teams) **decreases public trust in police**, which may contribute to **increases in crime**.Militarized police are **disproportionately deployed in African American communities**, even when **accounting for crime rates**.
https://www.acludc.org/sites/default/files/2020_06_15_aclu_stops_report_final.pdfThis **ACLU report** reviews 5 months’ of data from **DC police stops & searches** by **race and outcome**.The **black population of DC** is **25% greater than the white population**, but black people were **410% more likely to be stopped** by the police than **white people**This disparity **increases to 1465%** for stops which led to n*o warning, ticket or arrest and **3695% for searches** which led to no warning, ticket or arrest.This data indicates the **disproportionate stopping and searching of blacks in the DC area** extended **massively beyond** any **disproportionate rate of criminality.**
[**The Problem of Infra-marginality in Outcome Tests for Discrimination**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.05376.pdf)Analysis of **4.5 million traffic stops in North Carolina** shows blacks and latinos were **more likely to be searched than whites** (5.4 percent, 4.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively).Despite this, **searches of white motorists were the most likely to reveal contraband** (32% of whites, 29% of blacks, 19% of latinos).
https://drivingwhileblacknashville.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/driving-while-black-gideons-army.pdfBetween 2011 and 2015, **black drivers in Nashville’s Davidson County** were **pulled over at a rate of 1,122 stops per 1,000 drivers** — so on average, **more than once per black driver.**Black drivers were also **searched at twice the rate of white drivers, though** — as in other jurisdictions — **searches of white drivers were more likely to turn up contraband.**
[**A large-scale analysis of racial disparities in police stops across the United States**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0858-1.pdf)**Enormous** **study** of nearly **100,000,000 traffic stops** conducted across America.Analysis finds **the bar for searching black and hispanic drivers’ cars** is **significantly lower** than the bar for white drivers.Additionally, **black drivers are less likely to be pulled over after sunset,** when “a ‘veil of darkness’ **masks ones’ race”.****Biases by Judges, Juries & Prosecutors**
[**Demographic Differences in Sentencing: An Update to the 2012 Booker Report**](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171114_Demographics.pdf)Extensive multivariate regression analysis indicates **black male offenders receive 19.1% longer federal sentences than similarly-situated white male offenders** (white male offenders with similar past offenses, socioeconomic background, etc.)This disparity seems to stem mostly from **black males being 21.2% less likely to receive non-government sponsored downward departures or variances**.**Non-government sponsored departures and variances** refer to deviations from standard sentencing guidelines due to **judicial discretion**.Black males who **do receive** non government-sponsored departures and variations **still serve 16.8% longer sentences than white males on average**.In contrast, **when sentencing length follows standard guidelines, that disparity is only 7.9%**, and a substantial assistance departure for both groups **nullifies that disparity**.**IN SUMMARY** - much of the sentencing disparity between **similarly situated black males and white males** comes down to **judicial discretion** to **deviate from standard sentencing guidelines.****BONUS** **-** regression analysis suggests **violence in a criminal’s history does NOT** explain **sentencing disparities between black males and similarly situated white males** - the effect of that factor seems to be **statistically insignificant.****ADDENDUM** **- Some have asked me to clarify a sentence at the end of this report, where its authors write it cannot be used to prove discrimination on the part of judges. First, that disclaimer warns against inferring active discrimination as opposed to implicit bias - the disclaimer does not say the report cannot be used to prove implicit bias. Second, researchers are often quick to point out their research cannot prove a point, especially regarding intent. It can only strongly suggest a point - natural limitation of multivariate regression analysis.**
