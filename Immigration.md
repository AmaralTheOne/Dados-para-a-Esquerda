**Immigration Doesn’t Really Hurt Wages**
https://www.nber.org/papers/w12497.pdf**National Bureau of Economic Research** paper on the effects immigration has on wages in the United StatesStudy contends **previous analyses** on the relationship between immigration and wages **falsely assumed perfect labor substitutability between immigrants and native workers** of similar education levels, distorting resultsResearch shows average American wage **RISES due to immigration**, both short-term and long-term**Only native demographic whose wages drop are High School dropouts** who suffer a decrease in wages of approximately **~2% short-term, alleviating to ~1.1% over time.**Study finds **new immigration does severely impact wages of prior immigrants**, suggesting **lack of substitutability with \*natives**.Overall, **vast majority of American workers’ wages increase from immigration**, High School dropouts (<10% of population) experience a slight **decrease which alleviates with time** (and there is evidence that immigration [**may increase native High School graduation rates**](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18047.pdf), too).

**Diversity Doesn’t Hurt Social Cohesion**White supremacists will often argue racial diversity leads to less social cohesion than racial homogeneity. The data disagrees. Credit to Mouthy Infidel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTqctWuiqMJBehe1BH0JKtg) for this research.
