Long before stonewall, or any kind of queer organizing, LGBT people and Socialists were heavily involved in activism together. Oscar Wilde wrote a pamphlet called [The Soul of Man Under Socialism](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/wilde-oscar/soul-man/index.htm), the Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes was both a closeted gay man and a lifelong communist, and the anarchist Emma Goldman was a advocating for the rights of queer people many decades before Stonewall.

Additionally, the first politician to advocate for the rights of homosexuals was a German Socialist named August Bebel.

In 1917, after the Russian Revolution, homosexuality was decriminalized. Along with some of the first documented sex change operations having occurred in this period as well. Unfortunately, Stalin recriminalized homosexuality when he seized power.

One of the first Queer Liberation groups, [the Mattachine Society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qcddyFHmFw&feature=youtu.be) was founded by Communists, most notably by a gentleman named Harry Hay, and borrowed organizing tactics from the American Communist Party, in order to grow is initial support base.

[Stonewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots) was a literal, brick throwing riot, opposing police violence. And it was far from the only one of its kind. The Compton's Cafeteria Riot, and the Cooper's Donut Riot are just a couple of other examples.

Shortly after Stonewall saw the founding of The Gay Liberation Front, which was named after the National Liberation Front (otherwise known as the Vietcong), and donated money to The Black Panther Party. They also published a radical analysis of oppression of queer people in [Their Manifesto.](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/pwh/glf-london.asp)

During the HIV/AIDS crisis, groups like ACTUP were smuggling life saving drugs, forming guerilla clinics, and occupying government buildings.

Around that same time, [The Democratic Socialist Party of Australia put out A revolutionary strategy for gay liberation in 1982.](https://www.marxists.org/subject/lgbtq/pamphlets/A revolutionary strategy for gay liberation.pdf)

Today, there are concerns about how Capitalism negatively affects Queer people, in the form of things like [Queerbaiting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGJi0xHo_hE&feature=youtu.be), [Pink Washing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4LP0z493oY&feature=youtu.be), and [Homonationalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l3shYm6Jao&feature=youtu.be).

Furthermore, there is a group currently fighting in the Syrian Civil War, called [The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army (TQILA).](https://archive.org/details/FormationTQILA) It's an all LGBT batallion, and is the only one of its kind in the Middle East. It is a subgroup of an organization called the Insurectionary People's Guerrilla Forces (IRPGF), an anarchist group fighting in defense of the revolution in [Rojava](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqfoJvD0Ifg), in northern Syria. [They published this document not long ago: Not One Step Back: TQILA-IRPGF Communique.](https://archive.org/details/TQILAIRPGFCommunique)
